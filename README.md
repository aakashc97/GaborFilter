# GaborFilter
Implementing image processing using Gabor Filter in verilog.

The lineBuffer.v is used to create buffers to read pixels of a 512x512 image. 
The imageController.v instantiates the line buffers and generates a 3x3 window of pixels to be sent into the convolution module
The conv.v is where the convolution takes place. It has the Gabor Filter kernel which generated by python. It also has a Carry Lookahead Adder based multiplier which helps reduce propagation delay in convolution
The OutputBuffer.xci is a Xilinx FIFO IP which is used as an output buffer that stores the pixels after image processing before finally writing into a new image
The tb.v is the testbench which opens an image file and instantiates all the modules and then finally writes the pixels after convolution to a new image file
